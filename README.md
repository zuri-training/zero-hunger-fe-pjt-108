>## Action Map / Contribution Guidelines:

<b>1.</b> Fork the repository and clone the forked repo thereafter <br>
<b>2.</b> Set up the communication line:
  * Set the parent repo as your upstream 
  * for example: github.com/zuritraining/repo.git)
  ```css
  $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/zuri-training/zero-hunger-fe-pjt-108.git
  ```
   * Set the child repo (ie the one you forked github.com/your-username/repo.git) as your origin
   * for example:
  ```css
  $ git remote add origin https://github.com/franeldev/zero-hunger-fe-pjt-108.git
  ```
<b>3.</b>  Git checkout "branch" you are to work with
   * for example:
  ```css
  $ git checkout develop
  ```
<b>4.</b>  After updating the repo with your changes; add it to git and commit it with a short illustrative message that coincide
  * for example:
  ```css
  $ git add .
  ```
  ```css
  $ git commit -m "commit message"
  ```
<b>5.</b>  Fetch or pull from the upstream "branch" (if theres conflict, solve it) && git push origin "branch"
  * for example:
  ```css
  $ git pull upstream develop
  ```
   ```css
  $ git push origin develop
  ```
<b>6.</b> Make a pull request to the base branch that you are adviced to make a request - in this case, to the **develop** branch of the upstream. <br>
<b>7.</b> Above all, try to make sure you dont push directly to the Upstream Repo and if you get stuck, google or liaise with your Team Lead to put you through.

**PS:** Each time that you make changes after updating your local repo, kindly repeat from number 4 to number 6.
